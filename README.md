# Color Exercise

In this exercise we will pick the colors and fonts for the following use cases: 
1. Choose 3 colors and 2 fonts for an annual science fiction convention (`scifi.html`)
2. Choose 3 colors and 2 fonts for a furniture e-commerce site, that specializes in mid-century modern style furniture (`furniture-store.html`)

You can use the following resources to generate color palettes for inspiration, or create your own!

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## Deliverables

In each of the html files `scifi.html` and `furniture-store.html`:
1. Modify the colors/fonts at the top of file with things you choose. Feel free to get creative and modify other CSS on the page.
2. Take a screenshot of each `html` file rendered and add it to this README.md
